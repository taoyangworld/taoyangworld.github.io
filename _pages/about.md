Greetings! I am currently a Master student started from 2024 at the School of Mathematical Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), supervised by [Prof. Tingzhu Huang](https://www.math.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/2041.htm). I received my B.S. degree in the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Liaoning University(LNU) in 2024.

My research interests include:
- Low-rank tensor representation for muti-dimensional data.
- Diffusion models in low-level vison.
